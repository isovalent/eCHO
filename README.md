# eCHO - eBPF & Cilium Office Hours

With a little bit of imagination, eCHO stands for "eBPF & Cilium Office Hours". Inspired by [TGIK](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tgik) this is a livestream hosted by [Liz Rice](https://bsky.app/profile/lizrice.com) and [Duffie Cooley](https://bsky.app/profile/mauilion.dev) where we'll discuss all things related to the Cilium project and the broader world of eBPF. We'd love your questions during the show!
