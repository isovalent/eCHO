# Creating a new eCHO episode

## Preparation

**YouTube link and description**

* [ ] Set up the episode in YouTube Live so that we have a URL
* [ ] Add URL & topic description to event in eCHO calendar 
* [ ] Add URL & topic description to event listing in the [README](README.md) 
* [ ] Add the topic and guests to the YouTube live listing

**Episode notes**

* [ ] Draft the episode notes under a GitHub branch
  * There's a [tool](./episodes/README.md) to generate episode notes from the episode planning spreadsheet
* [ ] Prepare headlines (internal-only headline tracking spreadsheet is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Aq6sfOA06KbXNymt0UbBHYnvf-YWlR8e-oXjATzAigg/edit?usp=sharing))
* [ ] Add links to blogs or other resources
* [ ] Add links for the main topic
* [ ] Add link to YouTube (the same URL becomes the replay link for future viewers)

**Graphics and streaming setup**

* [ ] Prepare any graphics e.g. a "lower third" for any guests
  * Use the [lower third template in Keynote](https://github.com/isovalent/eCHO/blob/main/streaming-assets/lower%20third%20example.key) 
  * Replace the lower third graphic, with the following animations:
    * Build in: Dissolve duration 1s
    * Build on: Dissolve duration 1s, start 5s after previous build
  * Export as a movie with transparency so it can be used as an overlay. See the export settings screenshot below
* [ ] Set up scenes in Streamlabs OBS
* [ ] Test sound & screen sharing with guest

**Invitations**
* [ ] Send invite to guest with a Zoom meeting link (start 15 mins early)
* [ ] Invite a chat moderator
* [ ] Share event on social media
* [ ] Post & pin link to #general channel in eBPF & Cilium Slack

## Episode ready

* [ ] Test sound & screen sharing with guest

# After the episode

* [ ] Update & merge the episode notes as a PR
* [ ] Add link to the [README](README.md) and make sure next two episodes are listed
* [ ] Add episode to [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDg_GiBbAx-mY3VFLPbLHcxo6wUjejAOC)
